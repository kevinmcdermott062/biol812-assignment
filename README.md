## Welcome to my Biol 812 GitHub Pages Assignment 


### 1. When should you use Git for a project?
Anytime you want to ensure you have a back-up of the versions of your code/workand when you want to have multiple people collaborating on a project.

### 2. What kind of files/info should and should not be saved in a Git repository?

A Git repo is really useful to store code for coding projects. Data and any username/pw should never be stored in a Git repo as the repo is public.

### 3. What are the commands to undo a commit?
#### Undo a "public" change
Scenario: You just ran git push, sending your changes to GitHub, now you realize there's a problem with one of those            commits. You'd like to undo that commit.

** Undo with: git revert <SHA>

#### Fix the last commit message
Scenario: You just typo'd the last commit message, you did git commit -m "Fxies bug #42" but before git push you realize        that really should say "Fixes bug #42".

** Undo with: git commit --amend or git commit --amend -m "Fixes bug #42"

#### Undo "local" changes
Scenario: The cat walked across the keyboard and somehow saved the changes, then crashed the editor. You haven't committed those changes, though. You want to undo everything in that fileâ€”just go back to the way it looked in the last commit.

** Undo with: git checkout -- <bad filename>
   
### To review all the ways of undoing a commit, see this reference:
   
 [How to undo almost anything with git](https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git)
 
### 4. One of your repositories is in a detached HEAD state. How do you fix this?

git reset --hard

### 5. Your boss has no idea what Git is or why you are using it. Explain the pros / cons of using Git for your research project. Explain the pros / cons of hosting your project in a public (or private) repository on Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab/etc.
 
 
#### Pros for using Git

* Git is used for version control
* acts as a back up for all your work
* can revert to any previous version for my thesis/code/anaylsis.
* collaborators/PI can make traceable edits 
* edits can be accepted or ignored

#### Cons for Using Git

* all pages and information may be in the public realm
* all code is open to the public
* posting novel information here would be considered pubic disclosure which would void any IP claims.
